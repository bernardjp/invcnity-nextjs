<p>This project was conceive as an extension of the NextJS course provided by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCm5RVYKWVg" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> and created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxwvyK3-Xs4zvoGWFT_iDmw" target="_blank">Shadee Merhi</a>. The web design and page layout were created from scratch by me and uses original illustrations from <a href="https://storyset.com/" target="_blank">Storyset</a>.

The purpose of this project was to get a hands-on experience working with NextJS, Firebase, and ChakraUI, and encompass subjects like site structure and routing (using the brand new NextJS' App directory), custom theming with ChakraUI (Client Components) and styling with CSS Modules (RSC), Firebase integration with Firebase Authentication and Firestore to handle data persistance and security, and much more.

<h1>Key Features.</h1>
<p>This site work as a "storage" that helps to keep track of all the user's Real Estates findings and centralize all the information on a single plataform. In current times we are expected to navigate multiple plataforms to find a place to live (Airbnb, MercadoLibre, ZonaProps, even Real Estate Companies owns sites) making it harder to keep track of every single contender we find. This site helps to fill that organizational void and helps to keep the search tight and tidy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start off by creating a VCNITY: a themed storage unit that can store multiple Real Estate info units.</li>
  <li>Found a interesting house or apartment? Create a Estate inside the VCNITY with all the information about your findings.</li>
  <li>Did you finally visited the Estate? Did you like it enough to consider it a REAL contender? Do you want to rate it? Then do it! Keep all the information updated.</li>
  <li>One of your findings turn out to be no longer an option? Then delete it and make room to new ones!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Navigate</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">The data is stored locally in the project and contains all the information needed about each pack. Each card shows the name and basic info of each pack and can be filtered out to speed up the searching process. Click on the "card" and gain access to the detail page associated with the pack.</p>

<h2>Display details</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">In the detail page you will find a wide array of information including price detail, google maps integration, detailed itinerary, etc. Each pack page is generated dynamically making use of the "id" query parameter.</p>

<h2>Add to Cart and Checkout!</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">Once you added the pack into the cart you can proceed to the checkout page, there you can remove the pack from the shoping cart, go back to the details page, or finish the purchase. The cart stores all its items in the localStorage, and deletes them once the "purchase" is finished.</p>
